      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

# Ruby Client for Google Long Running Operations API ([GA](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))

[Google Long Running Operations API][Product Documentation]:

- [Client Library Documentation][]
- [Product Documentation][]

## Quick Start
In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
steps:

1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)

```

### Preview
#### OperationsClient
```rb
require "google/longrunning"

operations_client = Google::Longrunning.new
name = "my-name"
filter = project_id

# Iterate over all results.
operations_client.list_operations(name, filter).each do |element|
  # Process element.
end

# Or iterate over results one page at a time.
operations_client.list_operations(name, filter).each_page do |page|
  # Process each page at a time.
  page.each do |element|
    # Process element.

## Enabling Logging

To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-logging/latest/google/cloud/logging/logger)
that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.

Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:

```ruby
require "logger"

module MyLogger
  LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
  def logger
    LOGGER
  end
end

# Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
module GRPC
  extend MyLogger
end
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.3+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Core—that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.3
and later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.

  # ## Enabling Logging
  #
  # To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
  # The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
  # or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-logging/latest/google/cloud/logging/logger)
  # that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
  # and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.
  #
  # Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "logger"
  #
  # module MyLogger
  #   LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
  #   def logger
  #     LOGGER
  #   end
  # end
  #
  # # Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
  # module GRPC
  #   extend MyLogger
  # end
  # ```
  #
  module Longrunning
    # rubocop:enable LineLength

    ##
    # Manages long-running operations with an API service.
    #
    # When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed
    # to return {Google::Longrunning::Operation Operation} to the client, and the client can use this
    # interface to receive the real response asynchronously by polling the
    # operation resource, or pass the operation resource to another API (such as
    # Google Cloud Pub/Sub API) to receive the response.  Any API service that
    # returns long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interface
    # so developers can have a consistent client experience.
    #
    # @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
    #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
    #   be many types.
    #   A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
    #   authenticating requests made by this client.
    #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
    #   credentials for this client.
    #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
    #   credentials for this client.
    #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
    #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
    #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
    #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
    #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
    # @param scopes [Array<String>]
    #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
    #   an updater_proc is supplied.
    # @param client_config [Hash]
    #   A Hash for call options for each method. See
    #   Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
    #   this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
    #   or the specified config is missing data points.
    # @param timeout [Numeric]
    #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
    # @param metadata [Hash]
    #   Default metadata to be sent with each request. This can be overridden on a per call basis.
    # @param exception_transformer [Proc]
    #   An optional proc that intercepts any exceptions raised during an API call to inject
    #   custom error handling.

module Google
  module Protobuf
    # `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
    # URL that describes the type of the serialized message.
    #
    # Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
    # of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.
    #
    # Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.
    #
    #     Foo foo = ...;
    #     Any any;
    #     any.PackFrom(foo);
    #     ...
    #     if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
    #       ...
    #     }
    #
    # Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.
    #
    #     Foo foo = ...;
    #     Any any = Any.pack(foo);
    #     ...
    #     if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
    #       foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
    #     }
    #
    #  Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.
    #
    #     foo = Foo(...)
    #     any = Any()
    #     any.Pack(foo)
    #     ...
    #     if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
    #       any.Unpack(foo)
    #       ...
    #
    #  Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go
    #
    #      foo := &pb.Foo{...}
    #      any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
    #      ...
    #      foo := &pb.Foo{}
    #      if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
    #        ...
    #      }
    #
    # The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
    # 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
    # methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
    # in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
    # name "y.z".
    #
    #
    # = JSON
    #
    # The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
    # representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
    # additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:
    #
    #     package google.profile;
    #     message Person {
    #       string first_name = 1;
    #       string last_name = 2;
    #     }
    #
    #     {
    #       "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
    #       "firstName": <string>,
    #       "lastName": <string>
    #     }
    #
    # If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
    # representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
    # `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
    # field. Example (for message {Google::Protobuf::Duration}):
    #
    #     {
    #       "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
    #       "value": "1.212s"
    #     }
    # @!attribute [rw] type_url
    #   @return [String]
    #     A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
    #     protocol buffer message. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
    #     the fully qualified name of the type (as in
    #     `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
    #     (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).
    #
    #     In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
    #     expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
    #     scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
    #     server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
    #
    #     * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
    #     * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a {Google::Protobuf::Type}
    #       value in binary format, or produce an error.
    #     * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
    #       URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
    #       lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
    #       on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
    #       breaking changes.)
    #
    #     Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
    #     protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
    #     type.googleapis.com.
    #
    #     Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
    #     used with implementation specific semantics.
    # @!attribute [rw] value
    #   @return [String]
    #     Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type.
    class Any; end

module Google
  module Rpc
    # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
    # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
    # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
    #
    # * Simple to use and understand for most users
    # * Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
    #
    # = Overview
    #
    # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
    # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
    # {Google::Rpc::Code}, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
    # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
    # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
    # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
    # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
    # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
    # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
    #
    # = Language mapping
    #
    # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
    # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
    # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
    # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
    # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
    #
    # = Other uses
    #
    # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
    # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
    # consistent developer experience across different environments.
    #
    # Example uses of this error model include:
    #
    # * Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
    #   it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
    #   errors.
    #
    # * Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
    #   have a `Status` message for error reporting.
    #
    # * Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
    #   `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
    #   each error sub-response.
    #
    # * Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
    #   results in its response, the status of those operations should be
    #   represented directly using the `Status` message.
    #
    # * Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
    #   be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

    # @!attribute [rw] details
