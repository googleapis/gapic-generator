  # Behavior change:
  # gapic config: if region_tag is unspecified or region_tag is not unique, derive the 
  #   sample filename by concatinating method name, calling form, sample value set id
  # sample config: if region_tag (and id is unspecified), generator should auto-generate
  #   a unique filename for the sample. The generator will be unable to generate the same
  #   filename as in the gapic config because there is no `sample value set id` in the 
  #   sample config.
  #
  # "Hardcode" the ids here and below to make the samples have generated have the
  # same name as in the gapic config.
  #
  # TODO(hzyi): When we move the sample config completely we should remove the id field, adding a
  # `calling_pattern` field whose value is `[.*]`, and expect the generator to generate
  # samples will all avaiable calling forms, each with a unique filename.

  # Behavior change:
  # In gapic config, region tag defaults to `sample` if unspecified
  # In sample config, region tags are not generated if unspecified
  #
  # Add the region_tag here to mimic the old behavior and avoid too much
  # baseline changes at a time. 
  #
  # TODO(hzyi): When we completely switch to the sample config remove this field to test 
  # the new conifg and we should expect that region tag in generated sample 
  # to disappear
