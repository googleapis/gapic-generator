  # Behavior change:
  # gapic config: if region_tag is unspecified or region_tag is not unique, derive the
  #   sample filename by concatenating method name, calling form, sample value set id
  # sample config: if region_tag (and id is unspecified), generator should auto-generate
  #   a unique filename for the sample. The generator will be unable to generate the same
  #   filename as in the gapic config because there is no `sample value set id` in the
  #   sample config.
  #
  # "Hardcode" the ids here and below to make the samples have generated have the
  # same name as in the gapic config.
  #
  # TODO(hzyi): When we move the sample config completely we should remove the id field, change the
  # value of `calling_pattern` field of both samples to `[.*]`, and expect the generator 
  # to generate samples with all available calling forms, each with a unique filename.
