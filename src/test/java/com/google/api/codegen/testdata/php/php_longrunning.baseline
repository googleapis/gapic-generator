/**
 * Service Description: Manages long-running operations with an API service.
 *
 * When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed
 * to return [Operation][google.longrunning.Operation] to the client, and the client can use this
 * interface to receive the real response asynchronously by polling the
 * operation resource, or pass the operation resource to another API (such as
 * Google Cloud Pub/Sub API) to receive the response.  Any API service that
 * returns long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interface
 * so developers can have a consistent client experience.
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL: this client library class has not yet been declared GA (1.0). This means that
 * even though we intent the surface to be stable, we may make backwards incompatible changes
 * if necessary.
 *
 * This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * ```
 * $options = [
 *     'serviceAddress' => 'my-service-address',
 *     'scopes' => ['my-service-scope'],
 * ];
 * $operationsClient = new OperationsClient($options);
 * try {
 *     $name = '';
 *     $response = $operationsClient->getOperation($name);
 * } finally {
 *     if (isset($operationsClient)) {
 *         $operationsClient->close();
 *     }

     *     @type mixed $port The port on which to connect to the remote host. Default 443.
     *     @type Channel $channel
     *           A `Channel` object. If not specified, a channel will be constructed.
     *           NOTE: This option is only valid when utilizing the gRPC transport.

     *           A `ChannelCredentials` object for use with an SSL-enabled channel.

     *           If true, this forces gRPC to create a new channel instead of using a persistent channel.

     *           Path to a JSON file containing client method configuration, including retry settings.

     *           settings in $clientConfigPath.
