/**
 * `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
 * URL that describes the type of the serialized message.
 *
 * Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
 * of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.
 *
 * Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.
 *
 *     Foo foo = ...;
 *     Any any;
 *     any.PackFrom(foo);
 *     ...
 *     if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
 *       ...
 *     }
 *
 * Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.
 *
 *     Foo foo = ...;
 *     Any any = Any.pack(foo);
 *     ...
 *     if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
 *       foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
 *     }
 *
 *  Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.
 *
 *     foo = Foo(...)
 *     any = Any()
 *     any.Pack(foo)
 *     ...
 *     if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
 *       any.Unpack(foo)
 *       ...
 *
 * The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
 * 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
 * methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
 * in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
 * name "y.z".
 *
 *
 * # JSON
 *
 * The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
 * representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
 * additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:
 *
 *     package google.profile;
 *     message Person {
 *       string first_name = 1;
 *       string last_name = 2;
 *     }
 *
 *     {
 *       "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
 *       "firstName": <string>,
 *       "lastName": <string>
 *     }
 *
 * If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
 * representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
 * `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
 * field. Example (for message {@link google.protobuf.Duration}):
 *
 *     {
 *       "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
 *       "value": "1.212s"
 *     }
 *
 * @external "google.protobuf.Any"
 * @property {string} typeUrl
 *   A URL/resource name whose content describes the type of the
 *   serialized protocol buffer message.
 *
 *   For URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, the
 *   following restrictions and interpretations apply:
 *
 *   * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
 *   * The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully
 *     qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`).
 *     The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading "." is
 *     not accepted).
 *   * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a {@link google.protobuf.Type}
 *     value in binary format, or produce an error.
 *   * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
 *     URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
 *     lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
 *     on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
 *     breaking changes.)
 *
 *   Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
 *   used with implementation specific semantics.
 *
 * @property {string} value
 *   Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type.
 *
 * @see [google.protobuf.Any definition in proto format]{@link https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/any.proto}

/**
 * A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
 * as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
 * resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
 * or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
 * two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
 * from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.
 *
 * Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
 *
 *     Timestamp start = ...;
 *     Timestamp end = ...;
 *     Duration duration = ...;
 *
 *     duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
 *     duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
 *
 *     if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
 *       duration.seconds += 1;
 *       duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
 *     } else if (durations.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
 *       duration.seconds -= 1;
 *       duration.nanos += 1000000000;
 *     }
 *
 * Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
 *
 *     Timestamp start = ...;
 *     Duration duration = ...;
 *     Timestamp end = ...;
 *
 *     end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
 *     end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
 *
 *     if (end.nanos < 0) {
 *       end.seconds -= 1;
 *       end.nanos += 1000000000;
 *     } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
 *       end.seconds += 1;
 *       end.nanos -= 1000000000;
 *     }
 *
 * Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
 *
 *     td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
 *     duration = Duration()
 *     duration.FromTimedelta(td)
 *
 * @external "google.protobuf.Duration"
 * @property {number} seconds
 *   Signed seconds of the span of time. Must be from -315,576,000,000
 *   to +315,576,000,000 inclusive.
 *
 * @property {number} nanos
 *   Signed fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution of the span
 *   of time. Durations less than one second are represented with a 0
 *   `seconds` field and a positive or negative `nanos` field. For durations
 *   of one second or more, a non-zero value for the `nanos` field must be
 *   of the same sign as the `seconds` field. Must be from -999,999,999
 *   to +999,999,999 inclusive.

/**
 * `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:
 *
 *     paths: "f.a"
 *     paths: "f.b.d"
 *
 * Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
 * fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
 * message in `f.b`.
 *
 * Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
 * returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
 * Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).
 *
 * # Field Masks in Projections
 *
 * When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
 * sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
 * specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
 * example is applied to a response message as follows:
 *
 *     f {
 *       a : 22
 *       b {
 *         d : 1
 *         x : 2
 *       }
 *       y : 13
 *     }
 *     z: 8
 *
 * The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
 * (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
 * output):
 *
 *
 *     f {
 *       a : 22
 *       b {
 *         d : 1
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
 * paths string.
 *
 * If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
 * operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
 * had been specified).
 *
 * Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
 * top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
 * field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
 * list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
 * in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
 * other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
 * clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
 * any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
 * behavior for APIs.
 *
 * # Field Masks in Update Operations
 *
 * A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
 * targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
 * to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
 * and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
 * describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
 * fields not covered by the mask.
 *
 * If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, the existing
 * repeated values in the target resource will be overwritten by the new values.
 * Note that a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths`
 * string.
 *
 * If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
 * update operation, then the existing sub-message in the target resource is
 * overwritten. Given the target message:
 *
 *     f {
 *       b {
 *         d : 1
 *         x : 2
 *       }
 *       c : 1
 *     }
 *
 * And an update message:
 *
 *     f {
 *       b {
 *         d : 10
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * then if the field mask is:
 *
 *  paths: "f.b"
 *
 * then the result will be:
 *
 *     f {
 *       b {
 *         d : 10
 *       }
 *       c : 1
 *     }
 *
 * However, if the update mask was:
 *
 *  paths: "f.b.d"
 *
 * then the result would be:
 *
 *     f {
 *       b {
 *         d : 10
 *         x : 2
 *       }
 *       c : 1
 *     }
 *
 * In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
 * be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
 * Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
 * instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
 * not provide a mask as described below.
 *
 * If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
 * all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
 * Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
 * fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
 * the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
 * behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
 * a field mask, producing an error if not.
 *
 * As with get operations, the location of the resource which
 * describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
 * operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
 * required to be honored by the API.
 *
 * ## Considerations for HTTP REST
 *
 * The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
 * be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
 * (PUT must only be used for full updates).
 *
 * # JSON Encoding of Field Masks
 *
 * In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
 * separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
 * to/from lower-camel naming conventions.
 *
 * As an example, consider the following message declarations:
 *
 *     message Profile {
 *       User user = 1;
 *       Photo photo = 2;
 *     }
 *     message User {
 *       string display_name = 1;
 *       string address = 2;
 *     }
 *
 * In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:
 *
 *     mask {
 *       paths: "user.display_name"
 *       paths: "photo"
 *     }
 *
 * In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:
 *
 *     {
 *       mask: "user.displayName,photo"
 *     }
 *
 * # Field Masks and Oneof Fields
 *
 * Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
 * following message:
 *
 *     message SampleMessage {
 *       oneof test_oneof {
 *         string name = 4;
 *         SubMessage sub_message = 9;
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * The field mask can be:
 *
 *     mask {
 *       paths: "name"
 *     }
 *
 * Or:
 *
 *     mask {
 *       paths: "sub_message"
 *     }
 *
 * Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
 * paths.
 *
 * @external "google.protobuf.FieldMask"
 * @property {string[]} paths
 *   The set of field mask paths.

/**
 * A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone

/**
 * The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
 * programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
 * [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
 *
 * - Simple to use and understand for most users
 * - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
 *
 * # Overview
 *
 * The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
 * and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
 * {@link google.rpc.Code}, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
 * error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
 * developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
 * error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
 * localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
 * information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
 * in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
 *
 * # Language mapping
 *
 * The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
 * is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
 * exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
 * mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
 * in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
 *
 * # Other uses
 *
 * The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
 * environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
 * consistent developer experience across different environments.
 *
 * Example uses of this error model include:
 *
 * - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
 *     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
 *     errors.
 *
 * - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
 *     have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
 *
 * - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
 *     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
 *     each error sub-response.
 *
 * - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
 *     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
 *     represented directly using the `Status` message.
 *
 * - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
 *     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
 *
 * @external "google.rpc.Status"
 * @property {number} code
 *   The status code, which should be an enum value of {@link google.rpc.Code}.
 *
 * @property {string} message
 *   A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
 *   user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
 *   {@link google.rpc.Status.details} field, or localized by the client.
 *
 * @property {Object[]} details
 *   A list of messages that carry the error details.  There will be a
 *   common set of message types for APIs to use.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [google.protobuf.Any]{@link external:"google.protobuf.Any"}
 *
 * @see [google.rpc.Status definition in proto format]{@link https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto}
