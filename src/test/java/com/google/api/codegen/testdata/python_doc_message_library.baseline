class Any(object):
    """
    ``Any`` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

    ::

        Foo foo = ...;
        Any any;
        any.PackFrom(foo);
        ...
        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
          ...
        }

    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

    ::

        Foo foo = ...;
        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
        ...
        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
        }

     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

    ::

        foo = Foo(...)
        any = Any()
        any.Pack(foo)
        ...
        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
          any.Unpack(foo)
          ...

    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
    in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type
    name \"y.z\".


    # JSON

    The JSON representation of an ``Any`` value uses the regular
    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
    additional field ``@type`` which contains the type URL. Example:

    ::

        package google.profile;
        message Person {
          string first_name = 1;
          string last_name = 2;
        }

        {
          \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",
          \"firstName\": <string>,
          \"lastName\": <string>
        }

    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
    representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
    ``value`` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the ``@type``
    field. Example (for message ``google.protobuf.Duration``):

    ::

        {
          \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",
          \"value\": \"1.212s\"
        }

    Attributes:
      type_url (string): A URL/resource name whose content describes the type of the
        serialized protocol buffer message.

        For URLs which use the scheme ``http``, ``https``, or no scheme, the
        following restrictions and interpretations apply:

        * If no scheme is provided, ``https`` is assumed.
        * The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully
          qualified name of the type (as in ``path/google.protobuf.Duration``).
          The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is
          not accepted).
        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a ``google.protobuf.Type``
          value in binary format, or produce an error.
        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
          breaking changes.)

        Schemes other than ``http``, ``https`` (or the empty scheme) might be
        used with implementation specific semantics.
      value (bytes): Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type.

class Duration(object):

    A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
    as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond

class FieldMask(object):
    """
    ``FieldMask`` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

    ::

        paths: \"f.a\"
        paths: \"f.b.d\"

    Here ``f`` represents a field in some root message, ``a`` and ``b``
    fields in the message found in ``f``, and ``d`` a field found in the
    message in ``f.b``.

    Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
    returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
    Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

    # Field Masks in Projections

    When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
    sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
    specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
    example is applied to a response message as follows:

    ::

        f {
          a : 22
          b {
            d : 1
            x : 2
          }
          y : 13
        }
        z: 8

    The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
    (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
    output):


    ::

        f {
          a : 22
          b {
            d : 1
          }
        }

    A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
    field mask.

    If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
    operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
    had been specified).

    Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
    top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
    field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
    list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
    in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
    other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
    clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
    any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
    behavior for APIs.

    # Field Masks in Update Operations

    A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
    targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
    to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
    and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
    describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
    fields not covered by the mask.

    If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, the existing
    repeated values in the target resource will be overwritten by the new values.
    Note that a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a field
    mask.

    If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
    update operation, then the existing sub-message in the target resource is
    overwritten. Given the target message:

    ::

        f {
          b {
            d : 1
            x : 2
          }
          c : 1
        }

    And an update message:

    ::

        f {
          b {
            d : 10
          }
        }

    then if the field mask is:

     paths: \"f.b\"

    then the result will be:

    ::

        f {
          b {
            d : 10
          }
          c : 1
        }

    However, if the update mask was:

     paths: \"f.b.d\"

    then the result would be:

    ::

        f {
          b {
            d : 10
            x : 2
          }
          c : 1
        }

    In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
    be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
    Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
    instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
    not provide a mask as described below.

    If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
    all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
    Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
    fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
    the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
    behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
    a field mask, producing an error if not.

    As with get operations, the location of the resource which
    describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
    operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
    required to be honored by the API.

    ## Considerations for HTTP REST

    The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
    be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
    (PUT must only be used for full updates).

    # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

    In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
    separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
    to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

    As an example, consider the following message declarations:

    ::

        message Profile {
          User user = 1;
          Photo photo = 2;
        }
        message User {
          string display_name = 1;
          string address = 2;
        }

    In proto a field mask for ``Profile`` may look as such:

    ::

        mask {
          paths: \"user.display_name\"
          paths: \"photo\"
        }

    In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

    ::

        {
          mask: \"user.displayName,photo\"
        }

    # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

    Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
    following message:

    ::

        message SampleMessage {
          oneof test_oneof {
            string name = 4;
            SubMessage sub_message = 9;
          }
        }

    The field mask can be:

    ::

        mask {
          paths: \"name\"
        }

    Or:

    ::

        mask {
          paths: \"sub_message\"
        }

    Note that oneof type names (\"test_oneof\" in this case) cannot be used in
    paths.

class Status(object):
    """
    The ``Status`` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
    programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
    `gRPC <https://github.com/grpc>`_. The error model is designed to be:

    - Simple to use and understand for most users
    - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs

    # Overview

    The ``Status`` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
    and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
    ``google.rpc.Code``, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
    error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
    developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
    error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
    localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
    information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
    in the package ``google.rpc`` which can be used for common error conditions.

    # Language mapping

    The ``Status`` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
    is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the ``Status`` message is
    exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
    mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
    in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.

    # Other uses

    The error model and the ``Status`` message can be used in a variety of
    environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
    consistent developer experience across different environments.

    Example uses of this error model include:

    - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
    ::

        it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        errors.

    - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
    ::

        have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.

    - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
    ::

        `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        each error sub-response.

    - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
    ::

        results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        represented directly using the `Status` message.

    - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message ``Status`` could
    ::

        be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

    Attributes:
      code (int): The status code, which should be an enum value of ``google.rpc.Code``.
      message (string): A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
        user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
        ``google.rpc.Status.details`` field, or localized by the client.
      details (list[:class:`google.protobuf.any_pb2.Any`]): A list of messages that carry the error details.  There will be a
        common set of message types for APIs to use.
