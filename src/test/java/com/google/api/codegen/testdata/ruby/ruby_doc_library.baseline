      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  #
  # @param version [Symbol, String]
  #   The major version of the service to be used. By default :v1
  #   is used.
  # @overload new(version:, credentials:, scopes:, client_config:, timeout:)
  #   @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
  #     Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
  #     be many types.
  #     A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
  #     authenticating requests made by this client.
  #     A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
  #     credentials for this client.
  #     A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
  #     credentials for this client.
  #     A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
  #     A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
  #     should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
  #     A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
  #     metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
  #   @param scopes [Array<String>]
  #     The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
  #     an updater_proc is supplied.
  #   @param client_config [Hash]

    # This API represents a simple digital library.  It lets you manage Shelf
    # resources and Book resources in the library. It defines the following
    # resource model:
    #
    # * The API has a collection of {Google::Example::Library::V1::Shelf Shelf}
    #   resources, named +bookShelves/*+
    #
    # * Each Shelf has a collection of {Google::Example::Library::V1::Book Book}
    #   resources, named +bookShelves/*/books/*+

    # @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
    #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
    #   be many types.
    #   A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
    #   authenticating requests made by this client.
    #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
    #   credentials for this client.
    #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
    #   credentials for this client.
    #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
    #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
    #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
    #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
    #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
    # @param scopes [Array<String>]
    #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
    #   an updater_proc is supplied.
    # @param client_config [Hash]
    #   A Hash for call options for each method. See
    #   Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
    #   this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
    #   or the specified config is missing data points.
    # @param timeout [Numeric]
    #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
    # @param metadata [Hash]
    #   Default metadata to be sent with each request. This can be overridden on a per call basis.
    # @param exception_transformer [Proc]
    #   An optional proc that intercepts any exceptions raised during an API call to inject

module Google
  module Protobuf
    # +Any+ contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
    # URL that describes the type of the serialized message.
    #
    # Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
    # of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.
    #
    # Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.
    #
    #     Foo foo = ...;
    #     Any any;
    #     any.PackFrom(foo);
    #     ...
    #     if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
    #       ...
    #     }
    #
    # Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.
    #
    #     Foo foo = ...;
    #     Any any = Any.pack(foo);
    #     ...
    #     if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
    #       foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
    #     }
    #
    #  Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.
    #
    #     foo = Foo(...)
    #     any = Any()
    #     any.Pack(foo)
    #     ...
    #     if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
    #       any.Unpack(foo)
    #       ...
    #
    #  Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go
    #
    #      foo := &pb.Foo{...}
    #      any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
    #      ...
    #      foo := &pb.Foo{}
    #      if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
    #        ...
    #      }
    #
    # The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
    # 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
    # methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
    # in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
    # name "y.z".
    #
    #
    # = JSON
    #
    # The JSON representation of an +Any+ value uses the regular
    # representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
    # additional field +@type+ which contains the type URL. Example:
    #
    #     package google.profile;
    #     message Person {
    #       string first_name = 1;
    #       string last_name = 2;
    #     }
    #
    #     {
    #       "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
    #       "firstName": <string>,
    #       "lastName": <string>
    #     }
    #
    # If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
    # representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
    # +value+ which holds the custom JSON in addition to the +@type+
    # field. Example (for message {Google::Protobuf::Duration}):
    #
    #     {
    #       "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
    #       "value": "1.212s"
    #     }
    # @!attribute [rw] type_url
    #   @return [String]
    #     A URL/resource name whose content describes the type of the
    #     serialized protocol buffer message.
    #
    #     For URLs which use the scheme +http+, +https+, or no scheme, the
    #     following restrictions and interpretations apply:
    #
    #     * If no scheme is provided, +https+ is assumed.
    #     * The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully
    #       qualified name of the type (as in +path/google.protobuf.Duration+).
    #       The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading "." is
    #       not accepted).
    #     * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a {Google::Protobuf::Type}
    #       value in binary format, or produce an error.
    #     * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
    #       URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
    #       lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
    #       on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
    #       breaking changes.)
    #
    #     Schemes other than +http+, +https+ (or the empty scheme) might be
    #     used with implementation specific semantics.
    # @!attribute [rw] value
    #   @return [String]
    #     Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type.
    class Any; end

    # A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
    # as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
    # resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
    # or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
    # two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
    # from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.
    #
    # = Examples
    #
    # Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
    #
    #     Timestamp start = ...;
    #     Timestamp end = ...;
    #     Duration duration = ...;
    #
    #     duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
    #     duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
    #
    #     if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
    #       duration.seconds += 1;
    #       duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
    #     } else if (durations.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
    #       duration.seconds -= 1;
    #       duration.nanos += 1000000000;
    #     }
    #
    # Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
    #
    #     Timestamp start = ...;
    #     Duration duration = ...;
    #     Timestamp end = ...;
    #
    #     end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
    #     end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
    #
    #     if (end.nanos < 0) {
    #       end.seconds -= 1;
    #       end.nanos += 1000000000;
    #     } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
    #       end.seconds += 1;
    #       end.nanos -= 1000000000;
    #     }
    #
    # Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
    #
    #     td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
    #     duration = Duration()
    #     duration.FromTimedelta(td)
    #
    # = JSON Mapping
    #
    # In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an
    # object, where the string ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and
    # is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as
    # fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be
    # encoded in JSON format as "3s", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should
    # be expressed in JSON format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1
    # microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as "3.000001s".
    # @!attribute [rw] seconds

    # +FieldMask+ represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:
    #
    #     paths: "f.a"
    #     paths: "f.b.d"
    #
    # Here +f+ represents a field in some root message, +a+ and +b+
    # fields in the message found in +f+, and +d+ a field found in the
    # message in +f.b+.
    #
    # Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
    # returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
    # Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).
    #
    # = Field Masks in Projections
    #
    # When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
    # sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
    # specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
    # example is applied to a response message as follows:
    #
    #     f {
    #       a : 22
    #       b {
    #         d : 1
    #         x : 2
    #       }
    #       y : 13
    #     }
    #     z: 8
    #
    # The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
    # (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
    # output):
    #
    #
    #     f {
    #       a : 22
    #       b {
    #         d : 1
    #       }
    #     }
    #
    # A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
    # paths string.
    #
    # If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
    # operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
    # had been specified).
    #
    # Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
    # top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
    # field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
    # list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
    # in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
    # other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
    # clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
    # any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
    # behavior for APIs.
    #
    # = Field Masks in Update Operations
    #
    # A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
    # targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
    # to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
    # and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
    # describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
    # fields not covered by the mask.
    #
    # If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, the existing
    # repeated values in the target resource will be overwritten by the new values.
    # Note that a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a +paths+
    # string.
    #
    # If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
    # update operation, then the existing sub-message in the target resource is
    # overwritten. Given the target message:
    #
    #     f {
    #       b {
    #         d : 1
    #         x : 2
    #       }
    #       c : 1
    #     }
    #
    # And an update message:
    #
    #     f {
    #       b {
    #         d : 10
    #       }
    #     }
    #
    # then if the field mask is:
    #
    #  paths: "f.b"
    #
    # then the result will be:
    #
    #     f {
    #       b {
    #         d : 10
    #       }
    #       c : 1
    #     }
    #
    # However, if the update mask was:
    #
    #  paths: "f.b.d"
    #
    # then the result would be:
    #
    #     f {
    #       b {
    #         d : 10
    #         x : 2
    #       }
    #       c : 1
    #     }
    #
    # In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
    # be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
    # Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
    # instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
    # not provide a mask as described below.
    #
    # If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
    # all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
    # Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
    # fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
    # the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
    # behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
    # a field mask, producing an error if not.
    #
    # As with get operations, the location of the resource which
    # describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
    # operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
    # required to be honored by the API.
    #
    # == Considerations for HTTP REST
    #
    # The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
    # be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
    # (PUT must only be used for full updates).
    #
    # = JSON Encoding of Field Masks
    #
    # In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
    # separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
    # to/from lower-camel naming conventions.
    #
    # As an example, consider the following message declarations:
    #
    #     message Profile {
    #       User user = 1;
    #       Photo photo = 2;
    #     }
    #     message User {
    #       string display_name = 1;
    #       string address = 2;
    #     }
    #
    # In proto a field mask for +Profile+ may look as such:
    #
    #     mask {
    #       paths: "user.display_name"
    #       paths: "photo"
    #     }
    #
    # In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:
    #
    #     {
    #       mask: "user.displayName,photo"
    #     }
    #
    # = Field Masks and Oneof Fields
    #
    # Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
    # following message:
    #
    #     message SampleMessage {
    #       oneof test_oneof {
    #         string name = 4;
    #         SubMessage sub_message = 9;
    #       }
    #     }
    #
    # The field mask can be:
    #
    #     mask {
    #       paths: "name"
    #     }
    #
    # Or:
    #
    #     mask {
    #       paths: "sub_message"
    #     }
    #
    # Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
    # paths.
    # @!attribute [rw] paths
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #     The set of field mask paths.
    class FieldMask; end
  end

    # A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone
    # or calendar, represented as seconds and fractions of seconds at
    # nanosecond resolution in UTC Epoch time. It is encoded using the
    # Proleptic Gregorian Calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar
    # backwards to year one. It is encoded assuming all minutes are 60
    # seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second
    # table is needed for interpretation. Range is from
    # 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z.
    # By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to
    # and from  RFC 3339 date strings.
    # See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt).
    #
    # = Examples
    #
    # Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX +time()+.
    #
    #     Timestamp timestamp;
    #     timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL));
    #     timestamp.set_nanos(0);
    #
    # Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX +gettimeofday()+.
    #
    #     struct timeval tv;
    #     gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
    #
    #     Timestamp timestamp;
    #     timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec);
    #     timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);
    #
    # Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 +GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()+.
    #
    #     FILETIME ft;
    #     GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft);
    #     UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;
    #
    #     // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z
    #     // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
    #     Timestamp timestamp;
    #     timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL));
    #     timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));
    #
    # Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java +System.currentTimeMillis()+.
    #
    #     long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
    #
    #     Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000)
    #         .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();
    #
    #
    # Example 5: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.
    #
    #     timestamp = Timestamp()
    #     timestamp.GetCurrentTime()
    #
    # = JSON Mapping
    #
    # In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the
    # [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the
    # format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z"
    # where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},
    # {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional
    # seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),
    # are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone
    # is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
    #
    # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past
    # 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.
    #
    # In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the
    # standard [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString]
    # method. In Python, a standard +datetime.datetime+ object can be converted
    # to this format using [+strftime+](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime)
    # with the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one

    # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
    # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
    # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary

    # The +Status+ message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
    # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the +Status+ message is
    # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
    # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
    # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
    #
    # = Other uses
    #
    # The error model and the +Status+ message can be used in a variety of
    # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
    # consistent developer experience across different environments.
    #
    # Example uses of this error model include:
    #
    # * Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
    #   it may embed the +Status+ in the normal response to indicate the partial
    #   errors.
    #
    # * Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
    #   have a +Status+ message for error reporting.
    #
    # * Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
    #   +Status+ message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
    #   each error sub-response.
    #
    # * Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
    #   results in its response, the status of those operations should be
    #   represented directly using the +Status+ message.
    #
    # * Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message +Status+ could
    #   be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
    # @!attribute [rw] code
    #   @return [Integer]
    #     The status code, which should be an enum value of {Google::Rpc::Code}.
    # @!attribute [rw] message
    #   @return [String]
    #     A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
    #     user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
    #     {Google::Rpc::Status#details} field, or localized by the client.
    # @!attribute [rw] details
    #   @return [Array<Google::Protobuf::Any>]
    #     A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of
    #     message types for APIs to use.

# formatted_name = Library::V1::LibraryServiceClient.book_path("testShelf-" + Time.new.to_i.to_s, project_id)
# optional_foo = ''
# rating = :GOOD
# book = { rating: rating }
# update_mask = {}
# physical_mask = {}
# response = library_service_client.update_book(formatted_name, book, optional_foo: optional_foo, update_mask: update_mask, physical_mask: physical_mask)

      #   be many types.
      #   A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
      #   authenticating requests made by this client.
      #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
      #   credentials for this client.
      #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
      #   credentials for this client.
      #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
      #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
      #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
      #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
      #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
      # @param scopes [Array<String>]
      #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
      #   an updater_proc is supplied.
      # @param client_config [Hash]
      #   A Hash for call options for each method. See
      #   Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
      #   this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
      #   or the specified config is missing data points.
      # @param timeout [Numeric]
      #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
      # @param metadata [Hash]
      #   Default metadata to be sent with each request. This can be overridden on a per call basis.
      # @param exception_transformer [Proc]
      #   An optional proc that intercepts any exceptions raised during an API call to inject
      #   custom error handling.
