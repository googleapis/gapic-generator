        Args:
          service_path (string): The domain name of the API remote host.
          port (int): The port on which to connect to the remote host.
          channel (:class:`grpc.Channel`): A ``Channel`` instance through
            which to make calls.
          credentials (object): The authorization credentials to attach to
            requests. These credentials identify this application to the
            service.
          ssl_credentials (:class:`grpc.ChannelCredentials`): A
            ``ChannelCredentials`` instance for use with an SSL-enabled
            channel.
          scopes (list[string]): A list of OAuth2 scopes to attach to requests.
          client_config (dict):
            A dictionary for call options for each method. See
            :func:`google.gax.construct_settings` for the structure of
            this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
            or the specified config is missing data points.
          app_name (string): The name of the application calling
            the service. Recommended for analytics purposes.
          app_version (string): The version of the application calling
            the service. Recommended for analytics purposes.
          lib_name (string): The API library software used for calling
            the service. (Unless you are writing an API client itself,
            leave this as default.)
          lib_version (string): The API library software version used
            for calling the service. (Unless you are writing an API client
            itself, leave this as default.)
          metrics_headers (dict): A dictionary of values for tracking
            client library metrics. Ultimately serializes to a string
            (e.g. 'foo/1.2.3 bar/3.14.1'). This argument should be
            considered private.
