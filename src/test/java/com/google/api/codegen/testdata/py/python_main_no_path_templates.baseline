        Args:
            service_path (str): The domain name of the API remote host.
            port (int): The port on which to connect to the remote host.
            channel (~.grpc.Channel): A ``Channel`` instance through
                which to make calls.
            credentials (~google.auth.credentials.Credentials): The authorization
                credentials to attach to requests. These credentials identify this
                 application to the service.
            ssl_credentials (~.grpc.ChannelCredentials): A
                ``ChannelCredentials`` instance for use with an SSL-enabled
                channel.
            scopes (list[string]): A list of OAuth2 scopes to attach to requests.
            client_config (dict):
                A dictionary for call options for each method. See
                :func:`google.gax.construct_settings` for the structure of
                this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
                or the specified config is missing data points.
            app_name (str): The name of the application calling
                the service. Recommended for analytics purposes.
            app_version (str): The version of the application calling
                the service. Recommended for analytics purposes.
            lib_name (str): The API library software used for calling
                the service. (Unless you are writing an API client itself,
                leave this as default.)
            lib_version (str): The API library software version used

                client library metrics. Ultimately serializes to a string
                (e.g. 'foo/1.2.3 bar/3.14.1'). This argument should be
