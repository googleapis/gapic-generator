  # # Ruby Client for Google Example API ([Alpha](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
  #
  # [Google Example API][Product Documentation]: Tests no path templates
  # - [Product Documentation][]
  #
  # ## Quick Start
  # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:
  #
  # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
  # 2. [Enable the Google Example API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/library)
  # 3. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
  #
  # ### Installation
  # ```
  # $ gem install google-example
  # ```
  #
  # ### Next Steps
  # - Read the [Google Example API Product documentation][Product Documentation] to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
  # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md) to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.
