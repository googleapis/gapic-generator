    # +Any+ contains an arbitrary serialized message along with a URL
    # that describes the type of the serialized message.
    #
    #
    # = JSON
    #
    # The JSON representation of an +Any+ value uses the regular
    # representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
    # additional field +@type+ which contains the type URL. Example:
    #
    #     package google.profile;
    #     message Person {
    #       string first_name = 1;
    #       string last_name = 2;
    #     }
    #
    #     {
    #       "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
    #       "firstName": <string>,
    #       "lastName": <string>
    #     }
    #
    # If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
    # representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
    # +value+ which holds the custom JSON in addition to the +@type+
    # field. Example (for message Google::Protobuf::Duration):
    #
    #     {
    #       "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
    #       "value": "1.212s"
    #     }
    # @!attribute [rw] type_url
    #   @return [String]
    #     A URL/resource name whose content describes the type of the
    #     serialized message.
    #
    #     For URLs which use the schema +http+, +https+, or no schema, the
    #     following restrictions and interpretations apply:
    #
    #     * If no schema is provided, +https+ is assumed.
    #     * The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully
    #       qualified name of the type (as in +path/google.protobuf.Duration+).
    #     * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a Google::Protobuf::Type
    #       value in binary format, or produce an error.
    #     * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
    #       URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
    #       lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
    #       on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
    #       breaking changes.)
    #
    #     Schemas other than +http+, +https+ (or the empty schema) might be
    #     used with implementation specific semantics.
    # @!attribute [rw] value
    #   @return [String]
    #     Must be valid serialized data of the above specified type.

    # A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
    # as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
    # resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
    # or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
    # two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
    # from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.

    # Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.

    # +FieldMask+ represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:
    #
    #     paths: "f.a"
    #     paths: "f.b.d"
    #
    # Here +f+ represents a field in some root message, +a+ and +b+
    # fields in the message found in +f+, and +d+ a field found in the
    # message in +f.b+.
    #
    # Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
    # returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
    # Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).
    #
    # = Field Masks in Projections
    #
    # When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
    # sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
    # specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
    # example is applied to a response message as follows:
    #
    #     f {
    #       a : 22
    #       b {
    #         d : 1
    #         x : 2
    #       }
    #       y : 13
    #     }
    #     z: 8
    #
    # The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
    # (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
    # output):
    #
    #
    #     f {
    #       a : 22
    #       b {
    #         d : 1
    #       }
    #     }
    #
    # A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
    # field mask.
    #
    # If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
    # operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
    # had been specified).
    #
    # Note that a field mask does not necessarily applies to the
    # top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
    # field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
    # list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
    # in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
    # other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
    # clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
    # any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
    # behavior for APIs.
    #
    # = Field Masks in Update Operations
    #
    # A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
    # targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
    # to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
    # and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
    # describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
    # fields not covered by the mask.
    #
    # In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
    # be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
    # Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
    # instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
    # not provide a mask as described below.
    #
    # If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
    # all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
    # Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
    # fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
    # the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
    # behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
    # a field mask, producing an error if not.
    #
    # As with get operations, the location of the resource which
    # describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
    # operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
    # required to be honored by the API.
    #
    # == Considerations for HTTP REST
    #
    # The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
    # be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
    # (PUT must only be used for full updates).
    #
    # = JSON Encoding of Field Masks
    #
    # In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
    # separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
    # to/from lower-camel naming conventions.
    #
    # As an example, consider the following message declarations:
    #
    #     message Profile {
    #       User user = 1;
    #       Photo photo = 2;
    #     }
    #     message User {
    #       string display_name = 1;
    #       string address = 2;
    #     }
    #
    # In proto a field mask for +Profile+ may look as such:
    #
    #     mask {
    #       paths: "user.display_name"
    #       paths: "photo"
    #     }
    #
    # In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:
    #
    #     {
    #       mask: "user.displayName,photo"
    #     }
    # @!attribute [rw] paths
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #     The set of field mask paths.
    class FieldMask; end
  end
