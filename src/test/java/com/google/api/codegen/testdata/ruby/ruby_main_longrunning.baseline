    # Manages long-running operations with an API service.
    #
    # When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed
    # to return {Google::Longrunning::Operation Operation} to the client, and the client can use this
    # interface to receive the real response asynchronously by polling the
    # operation resource, or pass the operation resource to another API (such as
    # Google Cloud Pub/Sub API) to receive the response.  Any API service that
    # returns long-running operations should implement the +Operations+ interface
    # so developers can have a consistent client experience.

      #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
