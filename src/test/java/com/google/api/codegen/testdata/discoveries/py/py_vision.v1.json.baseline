---------------
1. If not already done, enable the Cloud Vision API
   and check the quota for your project at
   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/vision
2. This sample uses Application Default Credentials for authentication.
   If not already done, install the gcloud CLI from
   https://cloud.google.com/sdk/ and run
   'gcloud auth application-default login'
3. Install the Python client library for Google APIs by running
   'pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client'
