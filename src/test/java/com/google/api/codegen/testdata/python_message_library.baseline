class Any(object):
    """
    ``Any`` contains an arbitrary serialized message along with a URL
    that describes the type of the serialized message.


    # JSON

    The JSON representation of an ``Any`` value uses the regular
    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
    additional field ``@type`` which contains the type URL. Example:

        package google.profile;
        message Person {
          string first_name = 1;
          string last_name = 2;
        }

        {
          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
          "firstName": <string>,
          "lastName": <string>
        }

    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
    representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
    ``value`` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the ``@type``
    field. Example (for message ``google.protobuf.Duration``):

        {
          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
          "value": "1.212s"
        }

    Attributes:
      type_url (string): A URL/resource name whose content describes the type of the
        serialized message.

        For URLs which use the schema ``http``, ``https``, or no schema, the
        following restrictions and interpretations apply:

        * If no schema is provided, ``https`` is assumed.
        * The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully
          qualified name of the type (as in ``path/google.protobuf.Duration``).
        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a ``google.protobuf.Type``
          value in binary format, or produce an error.
        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
          breaking changes.)

        Schemas other than ``http``, ``https`` (or the empty schema) might be
        used with implementation specific semantics.
      value (bytes): Must be valid serialized data of the above specified type.

class Duration(object):

    A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
    as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
    resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
    or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
    two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
    from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.

    Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.

        Timestamp start = ...;

class FieldMask(object):
    """
    ``FieldMask`` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

        paths: "f.a"
        paths: "f.b.d"

    Here ``f`` represents a field in some root message, ``a`` and ``b``
    fields in the message found in ``f``, and ``d`` a field found in the
    message in ``f.b``.

    Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
    returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
    Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

    # Field Masks in Projections

    When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
    sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
    specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
    example is applied to a response message as follows:

        f {
          a : 22
          b {
            d : 1
            x : 2
          }
          y : 13
        }
        z: 8

    The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
    (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
    output):


        f {
          a : 22
          b {
            d : 1
          }
        }

    A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
    field mask.

    If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
    operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
    had been specified).

    Note that a field mask does not necessarily applies to the
    top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
    field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
    list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
    in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
    other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
    clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
    any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
    behavior for APIs.

    # Field Masks in Update Operations

    A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
    targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
    to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
    and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
    describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
    fields not covered by the mask.

    In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
    be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
    Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
    instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
    not provide a mask as described below.

    If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
    all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
    Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
    fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
    the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
    behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
    a field mask, producing an error if not.

    As with get operations, the location of the resource which
    describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
    operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
    required to be honored by the API.

    ## Considerations for HTTP REST

    The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
    be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
    (PUT must only be used for full updates).

    # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

    In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
    separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
    to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

    As an example, consider the following message declarations:

        message Profile {
          User user = 1;
          Photo photo = 2;
        }
        message User {
          string display_name = 1;
          string address = 2;
        }

    In proto a field mask for ``Profile`` may look as such:

        mask {
          paths: "user.display_name"
          paths: "photo"
        }

    In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

        {
          mask: "user.displayName,photo"
        }

    Attributes:
      paths (list[string]): The set of field mask paths.

class Timestamp(object):
    """
    A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone
    or calendar, represented as seconds and fractions of seconds at
    nanosecond resolution in UTC Epoch time. It is encoded using the
    Proleptic Gregorian Calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar
    backwards to year one. It is encoded assuming all minutes are 60
    seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second
    table is needed for interpretation. Range is from
    0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z.
    By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to
    and from  RFC 3339 date strings.
    See `https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt>`_.

    Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX ``time()``.

        Timestamp timestamp;
        timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL));
        timestamp.set_nanos(0);

    Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX ``gettimeofday()``.

        struct timeval tv;
        gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);

        Timestamp timestamp;
        timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec);
        timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);

    Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 ``GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()``.

        FILETIME ft;
        GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft);
        UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;

        // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z
        // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
        Timestamp timestamp;
        timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL));
        timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));

    Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java ``System.currentTimeMillis()``.

        long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();

        Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000)
            .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();


    Example 5: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.

        now = time.time()
        seconds = int(now)
        nanos = int((now - seconds) * 10**9)

      nanos (int): Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution. Negative
        second values with fractions must still have non-negative nanos values
