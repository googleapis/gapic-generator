# Introduction
This directory contains benchmark code used to measure overhead of generated client libraries.

This directory is experimental. It might be changed or removed in the future.

# TLS Certificate
Our benchmarks use TLS connections.
If the benchmark and the mock server is run on the same machine,
you can create your own TLS certificate by following directions
[here](https://workaround.org/ispmail/jessie/create-certificate)
and configure `Common Name` to `localhost`.

# Mock Server
The `server` directory contains a mock server that benchmarks can call RPCs against.
To run the server:
- [Install Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Install dependencies
  - `go get -u google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/pubsub/v1 google.golang.org/grpc`
- `go run server.go -key <keyfile> -cert <certfile>`
  - where `keyfile` and `certfile` are TLS key and certificate files, respectively
  - by default, server will start on `localhost:8080`
  - for more configuration, run `go run server.go -help`

# Common Options
Benchmarks of most languages accept some of the same options.

- `cert_file`
  - This is the TLS certificate file that the benchmark will use to established
    secured connection with the server.
- `client`
  - This option should either be "grpc" or "gapic", depending on which client you wish to benchmark.
- `num_workers`
  - This option controls how many concurrent RPCs may be made to the server.
  - Set to 1, the benchmark will measure RPC latency.
  - Set to a large number (say 20) the benchmark will fully load a CPU and measure CPU cost.

By default, benchmarks will make RPCs against the server at `localhost:8080`.

# Java
Benchmark for Java is located in the `clients/java/pubsub` directory.

To run the benchmark, you need to [install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

To run:
`mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.google.cloud.bench.Pubsub" -Dexec.args="-cert <cert_file> -c <client> -n <num_workers>"`

For more configuration, run the command with `-Dexec.args="-help"` to bring up the help menu.

# Go
Benchmark for Go is located at `clients/go/local.go`.
To run:
`go run clients/go/local.go -cert <cert_file> -client <client> -num_workers <num_workers>`

For the help menu, run `go run clients/go/local.go -help`.
